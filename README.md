# Nary User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to **Nary** â€” your personal chatbot assistant for managing tasks directly from the command line!  
Nary helps you keep track of **Todos**, **Deadlines**, and **Events** effortlessly.  
It stores all your tasks in a text file (`data/nary.txt`) so your progress is never lost between sessions.

## Quick Start

1. **Ensure Java 17 or above is installed** on your computer.  
   *Mac users:* Make sure you have the exact JDK version specified.

2. **Download the latest `.jar` file** from the official source.

3. **Copy the `.jar` file** to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Nary.

4. **Open a command terminal**, navigate (`cd`) into the folder containing the jar file, and run: `java -jar nary.jar`. A command-line interface will appear in a few seconds. Nary may display some sample tasks to start with.

5. **Type commands** in the terminal and press Enter to execute them.

**Example commands you can try:**

- `list` : Lists all current tasks.
